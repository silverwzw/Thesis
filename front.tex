File system is an important component of a operating system. It defines the way data is stored and retrieved. Its performance and efficiency affect overall operating system.

In this study, we design, implement, and validate a new file system built-on FUSE. The file system is a distributed file system with snapshot capability,that use MongoDB as storage backend. We introduce a patch-based new strategy to store snapshots. Further, we apply the rsync algorithm to enhance the efficiency of classic copy-on-write snapshot as well as the network performance. In addition, we studied the performance and the effect of some factors that effect the efficiency of rsync enhanced copy-on-write snapshot.

Test results indicate that the file system we proposed has performance comparable to the popular network file system NFS. Furthermore, it shows that the rsync enhanced copy-on-write snapshot system can boost the space efficiency of the snapshot system compared to classic copy-on-write snapshot system.
